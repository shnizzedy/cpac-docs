          - paragraph: De-Spiking
            details:
            - AFNI 3dDespike directly modifies the BOLD values which some may not like, vs. spike regression which affects all regressors/estimates, but does not directly modify the actual BOLD spike values.
            - AFNI 3dDespike does not account for broader spatial/global effects of spikes.
          - paragraph: Intensity Normalization
          - paragraph: Smoothing
            details:
            - Smoothing decreases the spatial resolution of functional data by replacing the signal at each voxel with a weighted average of that voxelâ€™s neighbors.
            - By averaging nearby voxels, we can cancel out the noise found in fMRI data and enhance the signal.
            - As we use larger smoothing kernels, the images become blurrier and the anatomical details become less distinct.
