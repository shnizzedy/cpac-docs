paragraphs:
  - paragraph: The anat-only preconfigured pipeline is a streamlined configuration designed specifically for anatomical data preprocessing. It is derived from the decisions and structure of C-PAC’s default pipeline, but isolates and enables only the anatomical processing steps, making it ideal for workflows that require structural preprocessing without functional data dependencies.
    subparagraphs:
    - paragraph: Brain Extraction
      details:
      - Utilizes AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip tool to isolate brain tissue from non-brain structures in the anatomical image. This is a crucial first step for reducing computational noise and improving the accuracy of subsequent processing stages.
    - paragraph: Tissue Segmentation
      details:
      -  Employs FSL’s FAST (FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool) to segment the brain into tissue classes—typically gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These segmentations are often required for both quality control and downstream applications like cortical thickness estimation or nuisance signal regression.
    - paragraph: Registration to Template
      details:
      - Performs anatomical normalization using ANTs/ITK-based nonlinear registration. This aligns individual subjects’ anatomical images to a standardized template space
