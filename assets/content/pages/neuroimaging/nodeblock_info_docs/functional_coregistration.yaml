      - paragraph: Creating the structural BOLD reference (Single-Band Reference/SBREF)
        details:
          - The “sbref” is a single-volume snapshot of the functional BOLD data which serves as a structural reference of the BOLD data.
          - This is used as an input for several operations, notably coregistration to the structural data, and any other operation which needs the BOLD data in a form that has clearer anatomical boundaries or landmarks.
          - The sbref is originally produced from the BOLD timeseries itself, but separate preprocessing can be performed on the sbref that is specific to the sbref, and would not be applied to the timeseries. Thus, sometimes it is possible for the final sbref to visually look a little different than the timeseries.
          - Some operations that may seem familiar from structural preprocessing can sometimes be used on the sbref - for example, N4 bias field correction, if needed.
