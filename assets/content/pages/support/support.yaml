      - This is a beta version of C-PAC, which means that it is still under active development. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable pipeline, there will likely still be a few bugs that we did not catch.
      - For a troubleshooting guide, please refer to the C-PAC Error Triage Flow. For more questions or comments about C-PAC, we invite you to contribute to the C-PAC Neurostars discussion forum.

      - If binding a local FSL installation, make sure to also tell C-PAC to use it
      - When pattern is set to default, the code searches for the first key it finds out of ['acquisition', 'SliceTiming', 'SliceAcquisitionOrder'] for slice time pattern

  - dropdown_title: Registration
    dropdown_details: 
      - If an error is happening to all/most subjects, that's more likely a pipeline or C-PAC problem (and might become an issue we need to resolve)
      - If it's happening to only some but not all, it's more likely a data-related issue (and might only require some pipeline configuration tweaks)
      - If it's the final bold timeseries in template space that's off, generally the two points in the pipeline that are most likely to be the culprit is either coregistration or the final warp to template. And sometimes but less often, the actual original registration (T1 to template).
      - Once the source has been isolated, check the Nipype working directory (if saved) to trace backwards. Find the subdirectory for the specific node that produced the step and check the command.txt or report.rst files inside to see the command run, check the inputs, etc.
