  - paragraph: The C-PAC Monkey Preconfigured Pipeline is a customized configuration within the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) framework, optimized for macaque neuroimaging data. This pipeline builds upon the default human preprocessing pipeline while integrating macaque-specific adaptations based on the work of Xu et al. and the hp-ABCD-BIDS-pipeline. It is designed to ensure high-quality anatomical and functional preprocessing, leveraging cutting-edge tools such as U-Net, ANTs, and ITK for enhanced performance in non-human primate (NHP) datasets.
    subparagraphs:
    - paragraph: Anatomical Preprocessing
      details:
      - Brain Extraction (U-Net) - Employs a deep learning-based U-Net architecture for precise and robust extraction of the brain from T1-weighted anatomical images.  Tailored for macaque anatomy to improve generalization over classical skull-stripping methods.
      - Tissue Segmentation (ANTs-Prior Based) - Utilizes ANTs prior-based segmentation, allowing for fine-grained classification of brain tissue types (e.g., GM, WM, CSF) using macaque-specific priors.
      - Registration to Template (ANTs/ITK) - Performs nonlinear registration of anatomical images to a macaque standard template using ANTs and ITK libraries.  Enables normalization for group-level analyses and integration with other datasets.

    - paragraph: Functional Preprocessing
      details:
      - Despiking - Detects and mitigates large temporal signal outliers in the time series, improving robustness for subsequent steps.
      - Slice-Timing Correction - Adjusts for differences in acquisition time between individual slices in an EPI volume to align temporal dynamics.
      - Motion Estimation & Correction - Estimates head motion parameters and corrects for motion-related artifacts, including rigid-body realignment across time points.
      - EPI N4 Bias Correction - Applies N4ITK bias field correction to EPI images to reduce intensity inhomogeneities caused by magnetic field distortions.
      - Brain Extraction (Anatomical-Refined) - Applies additional refinement to EPI brain masks using anatomical reference data, improving functional-anatomical alignment.
      - Co-Registration to Structural - Aligns the mean functional image to the subjectâ€™s structural T1 image for accurate overlay of functional data onto anatomical structures.
      - Nuisance Correction & Filtering - Regresses out nuisance signals (e.g., motion, WM, CSF) and applies temporal filtering to enhance signal-to-noise ratio.
      - Registration to Template (ANTs/ITK) - Warps preprocessed functional data to a macaque standard space using the same high-resolution registration tools as in anatomical preprocessing.
      - Spatial Smoothing - Applies spatial Gaussian smoothing to improve SNR and comparability across subjects by mitigating inter-subject anatomical variability.
