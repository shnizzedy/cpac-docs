paragraphs:
  - paragraph: The fmriprep-options pipeline is a preconfigured pipeline designed to enhance reproducibility and compatibility with the widely used fMRIPrep preprocessing tool developed by the Poldrack Lab at Stanford University. This configuration emulates the core preprocessing steps of fMRIPrep, allowing researchers who prefer C-PAC’s modular infrastructure to achieve comparable outputs, facilitating cross-study comparability and validation.
    subparagraphs:
    - paragraph: Anatomical Preprocessing
      details:
      - Skull-stripping - Uses AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip or FSL’s BET (depending on availability and configuration) to isolate brain tissue from the anatomical image.
      - T1-weighted bias field correction - Applies ANTs’ N4BiasFieldCorrection to correct for intensity non-uniformities.
      - Spatial normalization - Nonlinear registration to standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) via ANTs’ antsRegistration, matching fMRIPrep’s default.
  
    - paragraph: Functional Preprocessing
      details:
      - Motion correction - Realignment of volumes to correct for head motion using FSL’s MCFLIRT or AFNI’s 3dvolreg.
      - Slice timing correction - Optional, but aligned with fMRIPrep behavior; applied using AFNI’s 3dTshift if enabled.
      - Susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) - The pipeline supports fieldmap-based or fieldmap-less SDC via SyN distortion correction, echoing fMRIPrep’s recommendations.
      - Co-registration - Aligns functional and anatomical images using boundary-based registration (BBR) with FSL’s FLIRT.
      - Normalization to MNI space - Functional images are transformed to standard space using the same warp fields derived during anatomical normalization.
      - Confound regression outputs - Time series for motion parameters, anatomical noise components (e.g., aCompCor), and framewise displacement are generated for nuisance regression.
  
    - paragraph: Output Structure
      details:
      - Results are structured to emulate BIDS-Derivatives format, facilitating downstream compatibility with tools expecting fMRIPrep-style outputs.
      - Outputs include preprocessed functional images in native and standard spaces, transformation matrices, and various QC metrics.
