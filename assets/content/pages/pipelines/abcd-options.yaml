  - paragraph: ​The abcd-options preconfigured pipeline is tailored for processing BIDS-formatted MRI datasets, integrating methodologies from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and enhancements from the ABCD-HCP pipeline developed by DCAN Labs. This pipeline is designed to be robust across various scanners, acquisition protocols, and subject age ranges.​
    subparagraphs:
    - paragraph: Integration with DCAN-HCP Pipeline
      details:
      - The abcd-options pipeline incorporates the DCAN-HCP pipeline, which extends the HCP's minimal preprocessing pipelines. This integration facilitates comprehensive preprocessing of structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data.
      subparagraphs:
      - paragraph: Surface-Based Processing
        details:
        - Utilizing FreeSurfer-based surface processing, the pipeline generates outputs in both volume and surface spaces, aligning with HCP standards.
      - paragraph: Advanced BOLD Processing
        details:
        - The pipeline includes DCANBOLDProcessing modules that perform tasks such as motion correction, regression of confounding signals (e.g., white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, global signal), and bandpass filtering to enhance the quality of resting-state fMRI data. 
      - paragraph: Quality Assurance Metrics
        details:
        - Incorporation of the DCAN Executive Summary module provides automated quality assurance metrics, aiding in the assessment of preprocessing outcomes. 
      - paragraph: BIDS Derivatives Compliance
        details:
        - Outputs are structured to comply with BIDS derivatives specifications, facilitating downstream analyses and data sharing.
