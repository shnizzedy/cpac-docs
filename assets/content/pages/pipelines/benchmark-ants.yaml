# this is a C-PAC Docs content file 

paragraphs:
  - paragraph: The benchmark-ants pipeline is a standardized, reference configuration that leverages the ANTs/ITK (Advanced Normalization Tools/Insight Toolkit) suite for image registration. This pipeline has served as a cornerstone of C-PAC since its inception and remains largely unchanged across releases. Its primary purpose is regression testing—to verify the stability and consistency of C-PAC's key outputs across updates by comparing results against known benchmarks.
    subparagraphs:
    - paragraph: Anatomical Processing and Registration
      details:
      - The pipeline performs nonlinear registration to a standard template using ANTs. Specifically, anatomical images are aligned to the MNI152 template using SyN (Symmetric Normalization), a robust algorithm from ANTs known for its accuracy. This choice of registration tool influences subsequent steps like functional-to-anatomical alignment and standard space projection.
    - paragraph: Skull-Stripping
      details:
      - Skull-stripping is executed using ANTs-based tools, ensuring consistency with the registration methodology. This helps remove non-brain tissues from anatomical images, which is crucial for accurate alignment and segmentation.
    - paragraph: Tissue Segmentation
      details:
      - Segmentation of anatomical images into tissue classes (gray matter, white matter, and CSF) is conducted using FSL’s FAST. These segmentations are foundational for nuisance regression and mask generation later in the workflow.
    - paragraph: Functional Preprocessing
      details:
      - Functional images undergo standard preprocessing steps including
      subparagraphs:
      - paragraph: null
        details:
        - Slice-timing correction
        - Motion correction using FSL's MCFLIRT
        - Coregistration of functional images to anatomical space (also using ANTs tools)
        - Projection to standard space based on the anatomical-to-template warp fields computed earlier
    - paragraph: Nuisance Regression
      details:
      - The pipeline supports multiple denoising strategies, including
      subparagraphs:
      - paragraph: null
        details:
        - CompCor (both anatomical and temporal variants)
        - Global signal regression
        - Friston 24 motion parameters These options help remove confounds from the BOLD signal, aiding in isolating neural signal fluctuations.
    - paragraph: Spatial Smoothing and Temporal Filtering
      details:
      - Spatial smoothing is applied using a configurable Gaussian kernel. Temporal filtering (bandpass) helps reduce low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise, improving signal-to-noise ratio for functional connectivity analysis.
    - paragraph: Functional Connectivity Derivatives
      details:
      - The pipeline generates derivatives such as
      subparagraphs:
      - paragraph: null
        details:
        - Voxel-wise and ROI-based time series
        - Functional connectivity matrices
        - ALFF/fALFF and ReHo maps These outputs are essential for downstream analyses in resting-state fMRI research.
